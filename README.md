How to Deploy This Project
You can deploy your project using your preferred deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).

Connecting a Custom Domain
Most deployment platforms allow connecting a custom domain. Follow the platform's instructions to set up your domain.

I can also create a **slightly more user-friendly version with ready-to-use Vercel/Netlify instructions** if you want, so someone can deploy it immediately without Lovable. Do you want me to do that?
